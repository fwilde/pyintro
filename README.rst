# Introduction to Python: <br> Beginners Python programming course

This (two day) seminar was held at the university of Greifswald. The course materials can be used for independent self-study.

## Preparations

The course materials consist of Jupyter Notebooks. A Jupyter notebook is an interactive Python environment allowing to combine interactive execution of code along with formatted description texts, like an enriched, interactive lecture manuscript.

### Option 1: Install Anaconda on your machine

In case you prefer to use Jupyter Hub (in case you have university login credentials), you can skip this setup section. If you'd like to write and test your code independently from the university infrastructure and start from scratch, install the Jupyter environment locally on your machine, following the instructions below:

</font><font size="3"><b>Linux</b>

https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh

</font><font size="3"><b>Mac OS X</b>

https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg

</font><font size="3"><b>Windows</b>

https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-Windows-x86_64.exe <br><br>
    
or checkout <a href="https://anaconda.com">this link</a> to download the newest version.<br>

### Option 2: Use JupyterHub from within the university intranet

<b><i>If you're already connected via Wifi to eduroam</i></b> or via LAN in the university, you can access the JupyterHub, a Jupyter Notebook server runnning in the university cloud. As a student or employee of the university, you can use your default login credentials to login here
    
<a href="https://jupyterhub.wolke.uni-greifswald.de/hub/login">https://jupyterhub.wolke.uni-greifswald.de/hub/login</a>
    

<b><i>then simply choose "Datascience" as server type.</b></i><br><br>
You should see then a <i>Launcher</i>-Tab where you can choose to open a new <i><b>Python 3 Notebook</b></i> or a Linux terminal.
    
### Option 3: Use JupterHub remotely from home or anywhere else
    
<b><i>If you are not connected to eduroam or in the university intranet</b></i> because you're working from home, you have to install and setup a VPN client. Follow <a href="https://rz.uni-greifswald.de/en/services/technical-infrastructure/vpn/">these</a> instructions to install and setup the VPN client for the university of Greifswald  before you can use the JupyterHub in the university cloud.
    
### Download the course materials
    
<b><i>If you're using the JupyterHub</b></i>, either open a new Python 3 notebook and copy the lines<br><br>
    
<font size="4">
    
`%%bash
git clone https://github.com/fwilde/pyintro
`
    
</font>

into a cell of a new notebook and then execute the cell with <b>CTRL + Enter</b>.
    
    
<b><i>If you're using a locally installed version of Anaconda</b></i>, simply go to an arbitrary directory and clone the github repository with the course materials using the following command in a terminal:<br><br>
    
    
<font size="4">

`
git clone https://github.com/fwilde/pyintro
`
    
</font>
    
Then simply open one of the Jupyter notebooks. Have fun !
