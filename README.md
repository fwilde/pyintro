Introduction to Python: Beginners Python programming course
-----------------------------------------------------------

This (two day) seminar was held at the university of Greifswald. The course materials can be used for independent self-study.

## Preparations

The course materials consist of Jupyter Notebooks. A Jupyter notebook is an interactive Python environment allowing to combine interactive execution of code along with formatted description texts, like an enriched, interactive lecture manuscript.

### Option 1: Install Anaconda on your machine

**In case you prefer to use Jupyter Hub (in case you have university login credentials), you can skip this setup section.** If you'd like to write and test your code independently from the university infrastructure and start from scratch, install the Jupyter environment locally on your machine, following the instructions below:

**Linux**

[Anaconda for Linux](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh)

**Mac OS X**

[Anaconda for Mac OS X](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg)

**Windows**

[Anaconda for Windows](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-Windows-x86_64.exe)
    
or checkout [this link](https://anaconda.com) to download the newest version.

### Option 2: Use JupyterHub from within the university intranet

If you're already connected via Wifi to eduroam or via LAN in the university, you can access the JupyterHub, a Jupyter Notebook server runnning in the university cloud. As a student or employee of the university, you can use your default login credentials to login here
    
[https://jupyterhub.wolke.uni-greifswald.de/hub/login](https://jupyterhub.wolke.uni-greifswald.de/hub/login)
    

**then simply choose "Datascience" as server type.**
You should see then a **Launcher-Tab** where you can choose to open a new **Python 3 Notebook** or a Linux terminal.
    
### Option 3: Use JupterHub remotely from home or anywhere else
    
**If you are not connected to eduroam or in the university intranet** because you're working from home, you have to install and setup a VPN client. Follow [these](https://rz.uni-greifswald.de/en/services/technical-infrastructure/vpn/) instructions to install and setup the VPN client for the university of Greifswald  before you can use the JupyterHub in the university cloud.
    
### Download the course materials
    
**If you're using the JupyterHub**, either open a new Python 3 notebook and copy the lines
    
`
%%bash
git clone https://github.com/fwilde/pyintro
`

into a cell of a new notebook and then execute the cell with **CTRL + Enter**.
      
**If you're using a locally installed version of Anaconda**, simply go to an arbitrary directory and clone the github repository with the course materials using the following command in a terminal:    
   
`
git clone https://github.com/fwilde/pyintro
`
    
Then simply open one of the Jupyter notebooks. **Have fun !**
